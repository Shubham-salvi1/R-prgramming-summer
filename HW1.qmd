# Introduction

The **`mtcars`** dataset is a classic dataset that contains data about fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 cars (1973–74 models).

In this document, we create a plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus horsepower (hp), with cars grouped by the number of cylinders.

# Descriptive Statistics

-   Number of observations: `r nrow(mtcars)`
-   Variables: mpg (Miles per gallon), hp (Horsepower), cyl (Number of cylinders)

# The Plot

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars[, c("mpg", "hp", "cyl")])
library(ggplot2)

# commit 1 


# Create a scatter plot using ggplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  # Add points to the plot, sized for better visibility
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
   # Add informative labels and a title
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Horsepower", # Plot the title
    x = "Horsepower", # Plot horsepower on x axis
    y = "Miles per Gallon", # Plot mpg on Y axis
    color = "Cylinders" # This is the legend title
  ) +
  theme_minimal() # Applying a clean minimal theme for the overall plot
```

## Interpretation for the plot:

-   The plot shows a **negative relationship** between horsepower and fuel efficiency: as horsepower increases, the miles per gallon generally decreases. Cars with **more cylinders** (e.g., 8) tend to cluster at the higher horsepower and lower mpg range, while **4-cylinder** cars tend to have better fuel efficiency and lower horsepower.

-   This matches with expectations—larger, more powerful engines typically consume more fuel.

## Interpretation of the Statistics :

From the summary statistics:

-   **Miles per gallon (`mpg`)** ranges from **10.40** to **33.90**, with a **median of 19.20** and a **mean of 20.09**. The lower quartile (25%) is **15.43** and the upper quartile (75%) is **22.80**, indicating most cars fall within this efficiency range.
-   **Horsepower (`hp`)** ranges from **52** to **335**, with a **median of 123** and a **mean of 146.7**. The spread is wide, and the upper quartile is **180**, indicating some cars with significantly high horsepower.
-   **Number of cylinders (`cyl`)** has only three values: **4**, **6**, and **8**, with a **median of 6** and a **mean of 6.19**. The quartiles confirm a fairly balanced distribution, but slightly skewed toward higher cylinder counts.

These statistics provide context for the scatter plot. Higher horsepower typically correlates with more cylinders, which in turn is associated with lower fuel efficiency.
